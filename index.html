  <!--
    Here is the first of the new HTML sectioning elements, `<header>`. Its use is
    described in Chapter 16. When a `<header>` is used for content that describes the
    entire page, it can be useful to assign it a matching `id` value.
  -->
  <header id="header">
    <!--
      The first line of content is a semantically rich `<h1>` tag, probably the only one
      that should appear on the page, which includes the name of the site and a full,
      canonical URL to the site’s home page. The `<a>` tag here also uses the `rel-home`
      microformat, which is detailed at http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-home
    -->
    <h1><a href="http://example.com/" rel="home">Site Name</a></h1>

    <!--
      Next comes a site tagline, which can be a slogan or a short descriptive phrase that
      summarizes your site.
    -->
    <p class="tagline">Site Tagline</p>

    <!--
      Rounding out the `<header>` for the page is the `<nav>` tag, which surrounds an
      unordered list of links to the major areas of the site. Chapters 7 and 8 discuss the
      accessibility and usability of site navigation. Chapter 16 discusses the structure
      of navigation areas in HTML, and Chapter 21 covers how navigation fits with your
      site architecture.
    -->
    <nav id="navigation">
      <ul class="navigation">
        <!--
          This first item takes an `accessibility` class and is hidden from view in the
          RPK's `css/screen.css` file. See Chapter 7 for a discussion of accessibility
          enhancements to navigation for low-vision users and users of other assistive
          technologies.
        -->
        <li class="accessibility"><a href="#content">Skip to page content</a></li>
        <!--
          These two links, to Home and About, use root-relative links. If you need to use
          relative links, remove the opening slash before `/about/`. The link to `Home`
          will depend on how you have created the architecture of your site. See Chapter
          21.
        -->
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about/">ABOUT</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <!--
    Here, the `<main>` tag opens. `<main`> can only be used once per page, and should not
    have nested within it any repeating content, such as a repeated `<header>` or
    `<footer>`, or a site-wide `<aside>`. `<main>` is discussed in Chapter 16, and the MDN
    documentation for it is at https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main

    As another landmark section, `<main>` has its `id` attribute set to `content`, which
    is referenced in the accessible navigation using a fragment identifier (`#content`).
    See Chapter 16.
  -->
  <main id="content">

    <!--
      The RPK default structure uses an `<article>` element, which will likely be the
      proper sectioning element for most conetnt pages. An alternate pattern, using
      `<section>` as the primary grouping element, is presented below.

      Whether `<article>` or `<section>` is the primary element, it can take a landmark
      `id` value of `primary`.
    -->
    <article id="primary">
      <h2>HOBBIES</h2>

      <p>
        I enjoy cross-stitch, crotcheting, and knitting as relaxing activities during those rare moments I have to sit and relax.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally I love to read who-done-it type crime and mystery novels. One of my favorite authors is Patricia Cornwell. Her Kay Scarpetta series has had me intrigued for over 20 years. I also very much enjoy the Kinsey Millhone series by Sue Grafton. Sadly, Ms. Grafton is now deceased prior to publizing the Z title of the series (this is an alphabet based series starting with "A is for Aliby"). I've yet to complete either series but am in progress. Other authors I favor are Robin Cook, James Patterson, Tess Gerrisen, and Stephen King. I also have a whole slew of books waiting in my nook library from authors I want to start reading if I ever get enough time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exercise is also something I enjoy. Jogging on my treadmill and using my bowflex help me to not just keep in shape but relieve stress. Sadly, I don't get to do much of this when I'm both working full time and taking classes. Work and school take up much of my time, and then I have family and theocratic responsibilities as well.
      </p>

      <!-- Pattern for long `<article>` with multiple `<section>` elements: -->
      <!--
      <section>
        <h3>Section Title</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Section Title</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Section Title</h3>
      </section>
      -->

    <!--/#primary-->
    </article>

    <!--
      Use this markup pattern instead of `<article>` for a `<section>`-based overview-like
      page:
    -->
    <!--
    <section id="primary">
      <h2>Page Title</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Article Title</h3>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Article Title</h3>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Article Title</h3>
      </article>
    </section>
    -->

    <!--
      An `<aside>` tag appears here for structure supporting or sidebar-style content that
      is relevant to the entire page. As the comment below notes, `<aside>` should be
      nested with respect to the content it supports.
    -->
    <aside id="supporting">
      <h2>Supporting Content Title</h2>
      <!--
        If the supporting content is related to a specific article or section, nest your
        `<aside>` inside the relevant `<article>` or `<section>` tag. Do not reuse the
        `supporting` id if you have multiple `<aside>` elements on a page.

        And if the supporting content is repeated over multiple pages, move your `<aside>`
        element outside of the `<main>` tag.
      -->

    <!--/#supporting-->
    </aside>

  <!--/#content-->
  </main>

        The `colophon` list item, if you choose to include it, can contain links to
        projects like the RPK itself, as well as to any libraries or other services used
        to create and deliver your site. Including the colophon is, like any content in
        the RPK, optional.

        There are also two links to the HTML and CSS validators; they use a special
        ‘referer’ syntax and will only function properly on a publically available web
        server. They will not work on a development server like `http-server`. So you will
        need to manually validate your HTML and CSS at https://validator.w3.org/ and
        https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ until your site is live.

        Fun fact: *colophon* is a term derived from traditional book publishing. Some
        books include a short statement about the typefaces used in the book, artwork
        appearing on the cover, etc. See
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)
      -->
      <li class="colophon">
        Site created with the <a href="https://github.com/webpges/rpk">RPK</a> using
        <a href="https://validator.w3.org/check/referer">HTML</a> and
        <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">CSS</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </footer>


<!--
  Finally, at the very close of the page, this `<script>` tag loads up the RPK’s
  JavaScript file, which by default loads the jQuery library in a clever way and makes
  some minor modifications to the `<html>` tag’s opening `nojs` class.

  If you do not plan to use JavaScript, you can delete the `<script>` tag.
