          <p>
          I am an electrical designer with experiance in a variety of electrical applications. From commercial to utility/industrial and including lighting, equipment, grounding, fire alarm, and more. I also have some engineering experiance and am gearing my career more towards the engineering aspect of electrical design. I am looking to stay with in the utility and/or commercial industries and utilize my combined design/engineering experiences to explore new opportunites.
        </p>
        <p>
          In line with my goal of transitioning towars more engineering in my career I've been pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering with a focus on power systems and distribution. This type of focus falls in line with the experience I already have and the direction I want to go.

      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h3>Lighting</h3>
        <p class="lighting"/>
          I've done lighting design at a variety of types of establishments. This included normal lighting, emergency lighting, task lighting, and decorative lighting. I enjoy lighting design very much.
          In commercial applications there is a creative aspect to lighting. Beyond layout, there is a measure of enjoyment in choosing fixtures that compliment the architectureal theme of an area. Not to mention choosing colors to compliment or even to contrast, with the surroundings.

      <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoy cross-stitch, crotcheting, and knitting as relaxing activities during those rare moments I have to sit and relax.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally I love to read who-done-it type crime and mystery novels. One of my favorite authors is Patricia Cornwell. Her Kay Scarpetta series has had me intrigued for over 20 years. I also very much enjoy the Kinsey Millhone series by Sue Grafton. Sadly, Ms. Grafton is now deceased prior to publizing the Z title of the series (this is an alphabet based series starting with "A is for Aliby"). I've yet to complete either series but am in progress. Other authors I favor are Robin Cook, James Patterson, Tess Gerrisen, and Stephen King. I also have a whole slew of books waiting in my nook library from authors I want to start reading if I ever get enough time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exercise is also something I enjoy. Jogging on my treadmill and using my bowflex help me to not just keep in shape but relieve stress. Sadly, I don't get to do much of this when I'm both working full time and taking classes. Work and school take up much of my time, and then I have family and theocratic responsibilities as well.
