  <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
    <p>
      I enjoy cross-stitch, crotcheting, and knitting as relaxing activities during those rare moments I have to sit and relax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally I love to read who-done-it type crime and mystery novels. One of my favorite authors is Patricia Cornwell. Her Kay Scarpetta series has had me intrigued for over 20 years. I also very much enjoy the Kinsey Millhone series by Sue Grafton. Sadly, Ms. Grafton is now deceased prior to publizing the Z title of the series (this is an alphabet based series starting with "A is for Aliby"). I've yet to complete either series but am in progress. Other authors I favor are Robin Cook, James Patterson, Tess Gerrisen, and Stephen King. I also have a whole slew of books waiting in my nook library from authors I want to start reading if I ever get enough time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exercise is also something I enjoy. Jogging on my treadmill and using my bowflex help me to not just keep in shape but relieve stress. Sadly, I don't get to do much of this when I'm both working full time and taking classes. Work and school take up much of my time, and then I have family and theocratic responsibilities as well.
